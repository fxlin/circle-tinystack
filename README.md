Change options in Config.mk, which will override Rules.mk

workflow for rpi4, 64bit

load bootloader64 to uSD of rpi4

~~on *dev* machine, go to the app's dir, change code -> make -> sudo make flash~~
developing w/ eclipse seems for Linux only (windows is more difficult)

flash over serial seems enough

add/update Config.mk; high baudrate is fine. 

go to boot/, 
make firmware bootloader64

this will build bootloader in tools/bootloader. 

copy all to uSD. 
NB: the bootloader for rpi4 should be kernel8-rpi4.img
    for rpi3 32bit it's kernel7.img
    for rpi4 32bit it's kernel7l.img

copy config64.txt as config.txt

when bootloader starts, nothing will be on display (but the "rainbow" )


to see debug msg, make sure change cmdline.txt
logdev=tty1 loglevel=4
tty1: screen. ttyS1: UART
cf: doc/cmdline.txt

these will be loaded as kernel options

USB storage problem? make sure all firmware up to date

Circle
======

> If you read this file in an editor you should switch line wrapping on.

Overview
--------

Circle is a C++ bare metal programming environment for the Raspberry Pi. It should be usable on all existing models (tested on model A+, B, B+, on Raspberry Pi 2, 3, 4, 400 and on Raspberry Pi Zero), except on the Raspberry Pi Pico, which is not supported. Circle provides several ready-tested [C++ classes](doc/classes.txt) and [add-on libraries](addon/README), which can be used to control different hardware features of the Raspberry Pi. Together with Circle there are delivered several [sample programs](sample/README), which demonstrate the use of its classes. Circle can be used to create 32-bit or 64-bit bare metal applications.

Circle includes bigger (optional) third-party C-libraries for specific purposes in addon/ now. This is the reason why GitHub rates the project as a C-language-project. The main Circle libraries are written in C++ using classes instead. That's why it is named a C++ programming environment.

Release 43.3
------------

This intermediate release adds support for the **Raspberry Pi 400** and partial support for the **Compute Module 4**. The eMMC memory of the Compute Module 4 cannot be accessed at the moment.

On the Compute Module 4 the **internal xHCI controller** can be used to access the USB. You have to enable the system option `USE_XHCI_INTERNAL` in *include/circle/sysconfig.h* and to add the option `otg_mode=1` to *config.txt* for this purpose. The DWC OTG USB controller is not supported on the CM4.

The **performance of SD card access** has been improved by enabling the High Speed mode of the SD card, if supported. With a suitable uSD XC card, the read performance increased to up to 180%.

**Bug fixes** concerning USB plug-and-play, the deferred start of the network subsystem and some HID class standard gamepads have been applied.

Circle is tested using a GCC 10.2.1 based toolchain now. Be sure to update the used firmware to the files downloadable in the *boot/* subdirectory, when using this Circle release!

The 43rd Step
-------------

This release adds **USB plug-and-play** (USB PnP) support to Circle. It has been implemented for all USB device drivers, which can be subject of dynamic device attachments or removes, and for a number of sample programs. Existing applications have to be modified to support USB PnP, but this is not mandatory. An existing application can continue to work without USB PnP unmodified. Please see the file [doc/usb-plug-and-play.txt](doc/usb-plug-and-play.txt) for details on USB PnP support and [sample/README](sample/README) for information about which samples are USB PnP aware!

USB PnP requires the **system option USE_USB_SOF_INTR** to be enabled in [include/circle/sysconfig.h](include/circle/sysconfig.h) on the Raspberry Pi 1-3 and Zero. Because it has proved to be beneficial for most other applications too, it is enabled by default now. Rarely it may be possible, that your application has disadvantages from it. In this case you should disable this option and go back to the previous setting (e.g. if you need the maximum network performance).

An important issue has been fixed throughout Circle, which affected the **alignment of buffers used for DMA operations**. These buffers must be aligned to the size of a data-cache line (32 bytes on Raspberry 1 and Zero, 64 bytes otherwise) in base address and size. In some cases your application may need to be updated to meet this requirement. For example this applies to the samples *05-usbsimple*, *06-ethernet* and *25-spidma*. Please see the file [doc/dma-buffer-requirements.txt](doc/dma-buffer-requirements.txt) for details!

Another problem in the past was, that the output to screen or serial device affected the **IRQ timing of applications**. There is the system option `REALTIME`, which already improved this timing. Unfortunately it was not possible to use low- or full-speed USB devices (e.g. USB keyboard) on the Raspberry Pi 1-3 and Zero, when this option was enabled. Now this is supported, when the system option `USE_USB_SOF_INTR` is enabled together with `REALTIME`.

The new **class CWriteBufferDevice** can be used to buffer the screen or serial output in a way, that writing to these devices is still possible at *IRQ_LEVEL*, even when the option `REALTIME` is defined. Using the new **class CLatencyTester** it is demonstrated in the new [sample/40-irqlatency](sample/40-irqlatency), how this affects the IRQ latency of the system. Please read the [README file](sample/40-irqlatency/README) of this sample for details!

Building
--------

> For building 64-bit applications (AArch64) see the next section.

This describes building on PC Linux. See the file [doc/windows-build.txt](doc/windows-build.txt) for information about building on Windows. If building for the Raspberry Pi 1 you need a [toolchain](http://elinux.org/Rpi_Software#ARM) for the ARM1176JZF core (with EABI support). For Raspberry Pi 2/3/4 you need a toolchain with Cortex-A7/-A53/-A72 support. A toolchain, which works for all of these, can be downloaded [here](https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/developer-tools/gnu-toolchain/gnu-a/downloads). Circle has been tested with the version *10.2-2020.11* (gcc-arm-10.2-2020.11-x86_64-arm-none-eabi.tar.xz) from this website.

First edit the file *Rules.mk* and set the Raspberry Pi version (*RASPPI*, 1, 2, 3 or 4) and the *PREFIX* of your toolchain commands. Alternatively you can create a *Config.mk* file (which is ignored by git) and set the Raspberry Pi version and the *PREFIX* variable to the prefix of your compiler like this (don't forget the dash at the end):

```
RASPPI = 1
PREFIX = arm-none-eabi-
```

The following table gives support for selecting the right *RASPPI* value:

| RASPPI | Target         | Models                   | Optimized for |
| ------ | -------------- | ------------------------ | ------------- |
|      1 | kernel.img     | A, B, A+, B+, Zero, (CM) | ARM1176JZF-S  |
|      2 | kernel7.img    | 2, 3, (CM3)              | Cortex-A7     |
|      3 | kernel8-32.img | 3, (CM3)                 | Cortex-A53    |
|      4 | kernel7l.img   | 4B, 400, CM4             | Cortex-A72    |

For a binary distribution you should do one build with *RASPPI = 1*, one with *RASPPI = 2* and one build with *RASPPI = 4* and include the created files *kernel.img*, *kernel7.img* and *kernel7l.img*. Optionally you can do a build with *RASPPI = 3* and add the created file *kernel8-32.img* to provide an optimized version for the Raspberry Pi 3.

Then go to the build root of Circle and do:

```
./makeall clean
./makeall
```

By default only the latest sample (with the highest number) is build. The ready build *kernel.img* file should be in its subdirectory of sample/. If you want to build another sample after `makeall` go to its subdirectory and do `make`.

You can also build Circle on the Raspberry Pi itself (set `PREFIX =` (empty)) on Raspbian but you need some method to put the *kernel.img* file onto the SD(HC) card. With an external USB card reader on model B+ or Raspberry Pi 2/3/4 model B (4 USB ports) this should be no problem.

AArch64
-------

Circle supports building 64-bit applications, which can be run on the Raspberry Pi 3 or 4. There are also Raspberry Pi 2 versions, which are based on the BCM2837 SoC. These Raspberry Pi versions can be used too.

The recommended toolchain to build 64-bit applications with Circle can be downloaded [here](https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/developer-tools/gnu-toolchain/gnu-a/downloads). Circle has been tested with the version *10.2-2020.11* (gcc-arm-10.2-2020.11-x86_64-aarch64-none-elf.tar.xz) from this website.

There are distro-provided toolchains on certain Linux platforms (e.g. *g++-aarch64-linux-gnu* on Ubuntu or *gcc-c++-aarch64-linux-gnu* on Fedora), which may work with Circle and can be a quick way to use it, but you have to test this by yourself. If you encounter problems (e.g. no reaction at all, link failure with external library) using a distro-provided toolchain, please try the recommended toolchain (see above) first, before reporting an issue.

First edit the file *Rules.mk* and set the Raspberry Pi architecture (*AARCH*, 32 or 64) and the *PREFIX64* of your toolchain commands. The *RASPPI* variable has to be set to 3 or 4 for `AARCH = 64`. Alternatively you can create a *Config.mk* file (which is ignored by git) and set the Raspberry Pi architecture and the *PREFIX64* variable to the prefix of your compiler like this (don't forget the dash at the end):

```
AARCH = 64
RASPPI = 3
PREFIX64 = aarch64-none-elf-
```

Then go to the build root of Circle and do:

```
./makeall clean
./makeall
```

By default only the latest sample (with the highest number) is build. The ready build *kernel8.img* or *kernel8-rpi4.img* file should be in its subdirectory of sample/. If you want to build another sample after `makeall` go to its subdirectory and do `make`.

Installation
------------

Copy the Raspberry Pi firmware (from boot/ directory, do *make* there to get them) files along with the *kernel.img* (from sample/ subdirectory) to a SD(HC) card with FAT file system. Put the SD(HC) card into the Raspberry Pi.

The *config32.txt* file, provided in the boot/ directory, is needed to enable FIQ use in 32-bit mode on the Raspberry Pi 4 and has to be copied to the SD card in this case (rename it to config.txt). Furthermore the additional file *armstub7-rpi4.bin* is required on the SD card then. Please see [boot/README](boot/README) for information on how to build this file.

The *config64.txt* file, provided in the boot/ directory, is needed to enable 64-bit mode and has to be copied to the SD card in this case (rename it to config.txt). FIQ support for AArch64 on the Raspberry Pi 4 requires an additional file *armstub8-rpi4.bin* on the SD card. Please see [boot/README](boot/README) for information on how to build this file.

Directories
-----------

* include: The common header files, most class headers are in the include/circle/ subdirectory.
* lib: The Circle class implementation and support files (other libraries are in subdirectories of lib/).
* sample: Several sample applications using Circle in different subdirectories. The main function is implemented in the CKernel class.
* addon: Contains contributed libraries and samples (has to be build manually).
* app: Place your own applications here. If you have own libraries put them into app/lib/.
* boot: Do *make* in this directory to get the Raspberry Pi firmware files required to boot.
* doc: Additional documentation files.
* tools: Tools for building Circle and for using Circle more comfortable (e.g. a serial bootloader).

Classes
-------

The following C++ classes were added to Circle:

Base library

* CDeviceTreeBlob: Simple Devicetree blob parser

USB library

* CUSBSerialDevice: Base class and interface for USB serial device drivers
* CUSBSerialCDCDevice: Driver for USB CDC serial devices (e.g. micro:bit)
* CUSBSerialCH341Device: Driver for CH341 based USB serial devices
